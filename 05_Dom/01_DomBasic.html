Lets understand DOM, its called as document object model. An html is composed of objects of a document and thus collectively
they are document object model.

Lets see a DOM diagram for the below code.

                                               Window
                                                 |
                                              Document
                                                 |
                                                HTML
                                     |                        |
                                    Head                    Body
                                |          |             |        
                              Meta        Title         Div
                                                         |
                                                         P

    So we can manipulate DOM according to our needs and this concept is simply DOM manipulation.
