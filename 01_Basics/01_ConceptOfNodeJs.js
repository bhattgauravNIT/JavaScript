/**
 * Previously javascript was compiled only by the browser as only browser was having the compiler which can understand 
 * java script and therefore js was predominantly known as client side scripting language.
 * Thus previously if we needed to run a js file we needed to add scripts in the index.html and then run the local host
 * and then the browser was able to understand the script.
 * 
 * However later on the compiler was been taken individually and is knows as node.js.
 * This helps in understanding of the js code without the need of the browser and thus the scope of js increased to
 * server side as well.
 * 
 * Dino.js is also one such compiler.
 * Thus in order to run standalone js files in our machine we need node.js
 * 
 * 
 * Js is dynamically typed language as we don't give types of any variable and is by default taken by
 * js and moreover its one variable assigned to number can be again reassigned back to a string even.
